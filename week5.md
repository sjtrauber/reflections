Heatmaps are notoriously confusing - yet, biologists still love them. They show trends across conditions for relative comparisions which can be used as an intial place to look for more interesting results. However, they still have so much data that they are hard to parse through especially for someone new to the field who doesn't know all the gene names. 

This paper proposes interactive heatmaps. Making interactive heatmaps allows researchers to either search for genes of interest, or sort the heatmap by highest expresssion etc. This expanded functionality will allow researchers to have a deeper dive into the transcriptomics data than simply just the static image provided in a paper.
