Visualization: https://taiwandatastories.com/bubble-tea-guide/

I stumbled upon this visualization and found it very fun! I loved how much information they were able to share in a simple and clear way. I appreciated the input that they required from the reader, to engage my attention as I continued into the visualization. They had lots of information about each choice and lots of defaults that weaved through the background if you just were planning to glance through. 

However, they did not provide as much interaction as I wanted, when they showed the list of drinks to choose, I wanted a simpler way to categorize and organize the information. With a few adjustments, this would not be a difficult change and would make it much more interactive. Overall, I really like the visualization, just wish they had made a few more customizations to really make it great.
