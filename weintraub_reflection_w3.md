This paper discusses the dos and don'ts of publishing images. I found the simplistic but descriptive way they broke down complex discussions and analyses extremely helpful in creating my own images for presenting and publishing. By providing examples that were not only easy to understand but provided specifics as to why they chose each chart to represent their data they helped me make sense of what decisions they made to come to their conclusion.
